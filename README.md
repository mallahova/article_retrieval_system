# Article Retrieval System with Gemma and LangChain

## Overview
This project focuses on building an Article Retrieval System utilizing Gemma and LangChain. The system retrieves relevant article fragments based on a given query and incorporates them to enhance an input for a generative model, creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A system.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the [1300+ Towards DataScience Medium Articles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meruvulikith/1300-towards-datascience-medium-articles-dataset)  available on Kaggle.

## Setup
To run the Article Retrieval System, follow these steps:
1. Sign in or register at kaggle.com.
2. Open the [Gemma model card](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/) and select "Request Access"
3. (Optional) Verify your phone number [here](https://www.kaggle.com/settings) to be able to use the  GPU T4 x2 accelerator.
4. Run the Article Retrieval System in a Kaggle Notebook environment. You can copy my notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alisamalakhova/article-retrieval-system-with-gemma-and-langchain).
